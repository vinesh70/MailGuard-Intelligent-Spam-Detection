## MailGuard: Intelligent Spam Detection

### Overview
MailGuard is a Streamlit-based application for classifying emails as spam or ham using a Multinomial Naive Bayes model and TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization.

### Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinesh70/MailGuard-Intelligent-Spam-Detection.git
   cd MailGuard-Intelligent-Spam-Detection

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

### How It Works:
1. Text Cleaning: Lowercasing, tokenization, removal of punctuation and stop words, and stemming using NLTK's PorterStemmer.
2. Vectorization: Convert cleaned text into numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer.
3. Model Training: Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on vectorized text data.
4. Prediction: Input text is cleaned and vectorized, then fed into the trained model to predict whether it's spam or ham.
